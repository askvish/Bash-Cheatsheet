# Bash-Cheat-Sheet
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.<br>
First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions.<br>
Bash is the GNU Project's shellâ€”the Bourne Again SHell.<br>
This is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh).<br>
It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.<br>
It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use.<br>
In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.<br>
